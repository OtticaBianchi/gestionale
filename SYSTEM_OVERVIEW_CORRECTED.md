**Last Updated**: October 4, 2025
**Version**: 3.0.1

## Buste Workflow - Kanban States

### Current: 7 States (Manual Transitions)

1. **nuovo** - Customer just arrived, initial intake
2. **materiali_ordinati** - Products ordered from suppliers
3. **materiali_parzialmente_arrivati** - Some products arrived
4. **materiali_arrivati** - All products received
5. **lavorazione** - Lab is assembling/adjusting the eyewear
6. **pronto_ritiro** - Ready for customer pickup
7. **consegnato_pagato** - Fully paid ‚úÖ (auto-archives)

### Important Notes
- All state transitions are currently **MANUAL**
- Future plan: Make some transitions **AUTOMATIC** (to be defined)
- Target: Reduce to **6 states** (which state to remove TBD)

## Role-Based Access Control (CORRECTED)

### üë§ Operatore (Operator)
- **READ-ONLY** access to everything
- Cannot create, edit, or delete anything
- View-only mode for all modules

### üëî Manager
- Can do **ANYTHING** except:
  - ‚ùå Cannot DELETE buste
  - ‚ùå Cannot DELETE orders
  - ‚ùå Cannot DELETE clients
- Full create and edit permissions
- Access to all modules and features

### üîë Admin
- **FULL PERMISSIONS** - no restrictions
- Can delete buste, orders, and clients
- System configuration access
- Analytics dashboard access
- User management

## Material Order States (Automatic Transitions)

Material orders within each busta have their own lifecycle with **AUTOMATIC** transitions:

**Automatic States:**
- `da_ordinare` ‚Üí `ordinato` ‚Üí `in_arrivo` ‚Üí `in_ritardo` (if delayed)

**Manual States:**
- `consegnato`, `accettato_con_riserva`, `rifiutato`

These operate independently from the main busta workflow states.

## Key Differences from Previous Understanding

| Aspect | Previous (INCORRECT) | Current (CORRECT) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Number of busta states | 9 | 7 |
| State: misure_prese | Existed | REMOVED |
| State: consegnato_non_pagato | Existed | REMOVED (merged into consegnato_pagato) |
| Busta state transitions | Some automatic | ALL MANUAL (for now) |
| Operatore permissions | Could create/edit | READ-ONLY |
| Manager delete permissions | Could delete | CANNOT delete buste/orders/clients |
| Future busta states | Unknown | Planning to reduce to 6 |

## Notes for Future Development

### Planned Changes
- [ ] Reduce busta states from 7 to 6 (decision pending on which to remove)
- [ ] Implement automatic busta state transitions (TBD which states)
- [ ] Define rules for automatic progression

### Current Automation
- ‚úÖ Material order states (automatic: da_ordinare ‚Üí ordinato ‚Üí in_arrivo ‚Üí in_ritardo)
- ‚úÖ Delivery date calculations (business days only)
- ‚úÖ Follow-up call generation (7-14 days post-delivery)
- ‚úÖ Busta auto-archiving (7 days after consegnato_pagato)
- ‚ùå Busta state transitions (currently manual, automation planned)
