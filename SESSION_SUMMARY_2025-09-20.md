# Session Summary – 20 September 2025

## Context
- Worked on the OB Moduli branch after recent authentication/session fixes.
- Goal: reduce excessive polling traffic, tighten voice-note permissions, and align transcription logic with the production behaviour.
- Participants: admin + manager workflow review.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Voice Notes Module
- Added role-aware gating: admins and managers can fully manage notes; operators redirected to `/dashboard`.
- Removed the old PWA multipart fallback in the voice-notes API; Telegram webhook is the sole ingestion path.
- Optimised polling: dashboard voice-notes view now fetches every 60 s (only while visible) and cancels overlapping requests; manual actions still revalidate immediately.
- Sidebar badge now requests a lightweight `?summary=count`, lowering Supabase/Vercel usage.
- Prevented managers from deleting notes while allowing them to mark as completed, duplicate or link notes (only admins can delete).

### 2. APIs
- `GET /api/voice-notes`: exposes count summaries to admins/managers; full dataset requires manager+; auto-cleanup stays admin-only.
- `PATCH /api/voice-notes/[id]`: authorises managers in addition to admins; deletion remains admin-only.
- `GET /api/admin/telegram-auth`: managers can fetch counts; full list restricted to admins.
- `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/DELETE` cleanup now nulls FK references (buste, note, follow-up tables) before deleting auth.user, avoiding FK violations.
- `POST /api/track-time`: uses `getUser()` for validated session and logs edge-function failures as warnings (returns 202) to keep logout stable.

### 3. UI / Branding
- Header rebranded to “OB Moduli” v2.8 across loading/error/ready states.
- Dashboard logout button now delegates to the shared `UserContext.signOut` for consistent session cleanup.

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated docs to reflect automatic transcription at ingest (webhook ↦ AssemblyAI) rather than manual/on-demand transcription.
- Documented the current permissions model for voice notes (admins & managers).

## Impact on Quotas
- Polling load reduced by >90%; each user session now makes ~60 calls per hour instead of hundreds per minute.
- Sidebar count requests avoid returning full payloads—ideal for Supabase free tier.
- Auto transcription remains one AssemblyAI hit per note (unchanged), independent of UI refreshes.

## Outstanding Items / Follow-up
1. Deploy `update-online-time` Supabase function (current invocations return 404). Optional now that the API responds 202, but needed for session-tracking metrics.
2. Consider dynamic intervals (longer at night) or Realtime for voice notes if future traffic increases.
3. Once ready, deploy the updated code and test invitation flow + voice-note management with both admin and manager accounts.
